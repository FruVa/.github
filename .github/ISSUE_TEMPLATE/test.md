# Describe the test
The description should tell the tester what they are going to test. A description should be easy to read and immediately communicate the high-level goal of the test.

## Assumptions and Preconditions
You should include any assumptions that apply to the test and any preconditions that must be met prior to the test being executed. This information should describe dependencies on the test environment and any special setup requirements that must be done before running the test.

## Test Steps
Test cases should be simple. Keep in mind, the person who wrote the test case might not be the same person who executes the test itself.
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See result

### Expected result
The expected result tells the tester what they should experience as a result of the test steps. This is how the tester determines if the test case is a "pass" or "fail".
